Introduction

vim_aspync is a helper python library to ease working with code 
that need to wait vim to respond before executing other commands.

When executing vim commands from python, there are not executed immediately.
Instead, they are queued and executed all at once afte the `pythonx` command
returned. In particular, when an edit mode change is performed, vim won't
reflect the change when asking what is the current mode before vim resumed.

vim_aspync provides and event loop to built-in python event loop (using the
`async` / `await` mechanism) to run your functions as a coroutine, that coulbe
paused the time vim respond, and resumed immediately after.

To make it even simpler / natural, you only need to wrap your function with
`@vim_aspync.wrap`, and declare it `async def`.

As a side effect you also get a free async boilerplate, since `vim_aspync`
handles all the event loop boilerplate.

1) Introduction

Markpage is a bookmark plugin, that provide a very simple interface.

Here is the syntax of a bookmark entry: >

    <file path>:<line number> <short comment>
    <line content>
    <long comment>
    <long comment>
    ...



The algorithm will try to match the line content in the file, and will select
the most similar (Levenshtein distance if the `Leveneinshtein` python module
is installed, else simply find an exact match), and if several matches, the
one the nearest from the original position.

When clicking on a file path / line number, it will open the buffer at the
bookmark location in the previously selected window (similar to how NERDTree
works).
